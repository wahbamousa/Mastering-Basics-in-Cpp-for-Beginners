## 🤝 Contribution Culture & Feedback

Welcome! We’re glad you want to contribute to this project. To ensure high-quality contributions and smooth collaboration, please follow the guidelines below.

**We value teamwork, clarity, and purpose. Please read this before submitting any contributions.**

### 🛡️ Branch Protection Policies

To safeguard the `main` branch and uphold code quality, we have implemented the following branch protection rules:

- **Require pull request reviews before merging**: All changes must be submitted via pull requests and receive at least one approval from a designated reviewer before merging.

- **Require status checks to pass before merging**: Merging is only permitted if all CI checks pass successfully, ensuring that new code does not introduce errors.

- **Restrict who can push to the `main` branch**: Direct pushes to the `main` branch are restricted to authorized users, enforcing the use of pull requests for all changes.

These policies help maintain a high standard of code quality and promote collaborative development practices. For more details on branch protection rules, refer to the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/about-protected-branches).

By adhering to these practices, we aim to create a robust and reliable codebase that benefits all users and contributors.


### ✅ General Rules

- **Only contribute changes related to open Issues or PBIs (Product Backlog Items).**
- **Make small, focused commits** — one purpose per pull request.
- **Test and verify** your changes locally before pushing.
- **Pull the latest changes** from `main` before pushing to avoid merge conflicts.
- - **Code Style**: Follow same existing patterns in the file.  
- **Documentation**: Update the book content and `README.md` if needed.
